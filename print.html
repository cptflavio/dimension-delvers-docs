<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="minimum-viable-product-mvp"><a class="header" href="#minimum-viable-product-mvp">Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-an-mvp"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-mvp">What is an MVP?</a></h2>
<p>An MVP is a product with just enough features to satisfy the early players, and to provide feedback for future mod development. It is a product that is developed with the least amount of effort and resources, but still has enough features to be usable and valuable.</p>
<p>In other words, it is the "simplest" form of the mod as the team envisions it.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-an-mvp-important"><a class="header" href="#why-is-an-mvp-important">Why is an MVP important?</a></h2>
<p>An MVP is important because it allows the team to get feedback from the players early on in the development process. We set up an MVP to get something available fast. Our hope is that by doing so, the  team could get to work early, without having to wait for a decision process.</p>
<p>We also firmly believe that seeing is understanding. Having the players actually test the features will help them better understand and allows them to give feedback based on actual experience.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-polling-process"><a class="header" href="#what-about-the-polling-process">What about the polling process?</a></h2>
<p>We split the tasks in the MVP into 3 categories, Spike, Proof of Concept (PoC) and Feature (see <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>). While a feature is a certainty, the other two are not. The polling process ican still make these PoCs and Spikes into actual features, but they might also be getting scrapped completely. The developers should be aware that anything they make is not considered final until a poll is done.</p>
<h2 id="the-3-levels-of-features"><a class="header" href="#the-3-levels-of-features">The 3 Levels of features</a></h2>
<p>We identify 3 levels of features, with varying degrees of decidedness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong>: Something that is already decided or we have to do this either way. <em>Example: Rift Generation, Structure Generation, Modifier System, Remove Durability</em></li>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept (PoC)</strong>: One of the suggestions given by people. By creating a PoC, we will be able to test it out. If we only have 1 implemented PoC and we are all satisfied, then we might as well make it core. If we have a PoC and people have clear issues with the gameplay it brings, we must spend time on another PoC. <em>Example: Gear Sockets, Skill Crystals, Cost of dying, Abilities</em></li>
<li><strong>Spike</strong>: A spike is something we know we need, but we have not yet discussed how to do it, or maybe we have discussed it, but no clear path to implementation. Spikes can be very exploratory, sometimes even involving a mini PoC. Spikes generally should not be too long, just enough time to prove it might work. <em>Example: Multiblock Altar, Wireframe Minimap</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mvp-featurelist"><a class="header" href="#mvp-featurelist">MVP Featurelist</a></h2>
<p>The MVP contains following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Stat System - Should be easily accessible from other systems
<ul>
<li><em>Spike</em>: Vanilla Attributes =&gt; Make a list of Vanilla attributes and missing attributes we need</li>
<li><em>Feature</em>: Entity Modifiers, based on vanilla Enchantment code, but better, for <strong>max Datapacking power</strong> =&gt; Usable for Gear Sockets, Implicits, Skill Trees, Food, Collectable unlocks, Levelling system, Champion Mobs, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability System
<ul>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Abilities are datapackable and allow for a lot of variety. They have cooldowns and are each triggered by a configurable keybind.</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Abilities are stored on an item that you equip in a set of special slots</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Abilities have a randomized Skill Tree that gives minor boosts to the ability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gear
<ul>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Socket System
<ul>
<li>Runegems drop that can be applied to gear to give it a modifier</li>
<li>Runegems have different tiers of power</li>
<li>Gear can have up to 6 sockets</li>
<li>Each Socket can only take one shape of runegems</li>
<li>The Rune Anvil is used to apply runegems to gear</li>
<li>Vanilla gear can also have Gear Sockets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Enchantments completely removed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rift
<ul>
<li><em>Feature</em>: Player Accessing the Rift (Entering/Leaving) =&gt; Dimension Generation</li>
<li><em>Feature</em>: Rift Generation in a 15x15 grid =&gt; Basic Jigsaw Structure Generation</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Rift Stability System
<ul>
<li>The further away from the rift portal you go, the messier and more difficult to travers the rift becomes.</li>
<li>The stable areas have easy to traverse terrain and always 4 central exits on the sides.</li>
<li>The unstable areas still have the 4 exits, but make it more difficult to reach them.</li>
<li>The chaos areas have different size rooms and corridors, and the placement and number of exits is more randomized. (Not part of MVP)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Spike</em>: PoIs =&gt; Points of Interest
<ul>
<li>3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Processors are used to generate Themes
<ul>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Simple Cave theme</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Simple Forest theme</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Rift Key Creation is done by distilling blocks into essences and these essences help dictate what kind of theme is generated.</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Portal Block that can be used to make a freestanding portal or one against a wall.</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: RiftMapper, a system to display the rift in a 3D map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rift Content
<ul>
<li><em>Spike</em>: Spawner =&gt; Make vanilla mobs spawn in a configurable way using Processors</li>
<li>Only vanilla mobs will spawn</li>
<li><em>PoC</em>: Chests and chestlooting
<ul>
<li>just 1 chest for MVP and no chest slicing for MVP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Spike</em>: Simplest objective (Kill X monsters)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other
<ul>
<li><em>Spike</em>: Keep original Inventory system for rift</li>
<li><em>Feature</em>: Removal of durability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mod code is located at the <a href="https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-mod.git">dimension-delvers-mod GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<p>The intent of the mod is to provide a primary framework for the modpack. In the long term, this should be standalone, but as we start out, we will focus on making the best mod for our own modpack.</p>

<p>The Pack code is located at the <a href="https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-pack.git">dimension-delvers-pack GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<p>The pack will add additional things that around the mod to make it a full modpack.</p>
<h2 id="project-board"><a class="header" href="#project-board">Project Board</a></h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Dimension-Delvers/projects/1/views/1">project board</a>, contains a running list of all our open tasks. Anyone can pick up any ticket on this board. The coordinators will follow up, to ensure everything goes smoothly. The labels indicate the kind of work to be done for a ticket. There are 3 types of tasks on it, Feature, PoC and Spike.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature</strong>: Something that is already decided or we have to do this either way. This task is primarily coding work, most details should be ironed out already. <em>Example: Rift Generation, Structure Generation, Modifier System (our better version of enchantments)</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Proof of Concept (PoC)</strong>: The implementation of one of the suggestions given by people. By creating a PoC, we will be able to test it out, to help deciding if we want to continue on it. PoCs still require a lot of conversation, so try to involve the team as much as possible before implementing things. <em>Example: Gear Sockets, AbilitY Crystals, Cost of dying</em></li>
<li><strong>Spike</strong>: A spike is something we know we need, but we have not yet discussed how to do it, or maybe we have discussed it high level, but no clear path to implementation. Spikes can be very exploratory, sometimes even involving a mini PoC. Spikes generally should not be too long, just enough time to prove it might work.

<p>A lot of the content in WotR is added through a unique datapack format. Modpack makers can fully customize how specific things look and behave through easy to understand datapacks. Adding the datapack works exactly as it does in vanilla minecraft, so it shouldn't pose too much troubles.</p>
<h2 id="datapacks"><a class="header" href="#datapacks">Datapacks?</a></h2>
<p>New to making a datapack? The <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Creating_a_data_pack">MC wiki's datapack creation page</a> has you covered. Just imagine the below formats to be in the very same vanilla list and everything will work out just fine.</p>
<h2 id="wanderers-of-the-rift-namespace"><a class="header" href="#wanderers-of-the-rift-namespace">Wanderers of the Rift namespace</a></h2>
<p>The namespace in a datapack works a bit like the mod name. Mods have their own datapacks included with their own namespace. The Wanderers of the Rift mod's namespace is <code>wotr</code>. In this namespace we have added some basic examples that can guide you to create some new unique variations.</p>

<p>Where walls, paths and floors comprise the bulk of the room.</p>
<p>Alt wall can be used for etching, and indicators like cracks.
Dark floor can be used in corners, further away from the path.
Planks will (almost) always be planks, for things like bridges.
Bricks can be used to indicate a more solid part.</p>
<p>Use these when making builds, both rooms and POIs, so the processors can easily target them.
<img src="builds/processor_blocks.png" alt="processor_blocks" /></p>
<p>Water can be used in the build as the themed liquid.</p>
<p>The other processor blocks can be used, but require a custom processor from the builder, and will be room specific, eg. a tree always needing logs.</p>
<h2 id="room-sizes"><a class="header" href="#room-sizes">Room Sizes</a></h2>
<p>The size of a room is indicated with a multiple of the gridlenght, being 15. The number between brackets indicates the fixed multiplier, in X, Y and Z direction, respectively.</p>
<p>Stable (3x3x3), standard room near the start, 47 blocks in every direction, and all doors easely reachable.<br />
Unstable (3xYx3), doors are not easely reachable anymore, and is used as a step between Stable and Chaos).<br />
Chaos (XxYxZ), doors are not in the center of a face anymore, has varying sizes, and makes the generated rift maze-like.</p>
<h2 id="room-builds"><a class="header" href="#room-builds">Room Builds</a></h2>
<p>All edges of the rooms need to be at least 3 blocks thick. This is not a hard rule, but try to have &gt;90% of the walls 3 blocks thick<br />
Leave spaces for POIs, which will be randomly generated on set positions. A jigsaw block needs to be placed in the center of the POI location.</p>
<p>Chaos rooms need 1/3 of their doors to remain open, with the jigsaw blocks inside them. Those doors need to be scattered around the room. The other doorways can be covered by processor blocks, but not by bedrock.</p>
<h2 id="room-naming"><a class="header" href="#room-naming">Room Naming</a></h2>
<p>The created room has to be saved using the following structure:<br />
<code>wotr:rift/room/stability/XYZ/roomname</code> ,<br />
Where Stability is Stable, Unstable or Chaos, XYZ is the size in every direction (1, 2 or 3), and roomname is the name of the room, chosen by the builder.<br />
Example: <code>wotr:rift/room/stable/333/test_room</code>.</p>
<h2 id="poi-sizes"><a class="header" href="#poi-sizes">POI sizes</a></h2>
<p>The POI sizes will be (X, Y, Z):<br />
(3, 3, 3)*, (5, 5, 5), (7, 6, 7), (9, 8, 9), (11, 9, 11)*.<br />
This is the outer size of the POI, not counting the floor layer.<br />
*Up for debate, might very well be removed.</p>

<li><strong>Proof of Concept (PoC)</strong>: One of the suggestions given by people. By creating a PoC, we will be able to test it out. If we only have 1 implemented PoC and we are all satisfied, then we might as well make it core. If we have a PoC and people have clear issues with the gameplay it brings, we must spend time on another PoC. <em>Example: Gear Sockets, Skill Crystals, Cost of dying</em></li>
<li><strong>Spike</strong>: A spike is something we know we need, but we have not yet discussed how to do it, or maybe we have discussed it, but no clear path to implementation. Spikes can be very exploratory, sometimes even involving a mini PoC. Spikes generally should not be too long, just enough time to prove it might work. <em>Example: Multiblock Altar, Wireframe Minimap, Abilities</em></li>
<li><strong>Datapack</strong>: A task to add a set of jsons as per <a href="code/datapack/datapack-formats.html">the datapack formats</a>. This task usually follows up on a relevant code ticket. This can be picked up by people with no skills in java.</li>

<li><strong>JigSaw</strong>: The technical vanilla minecraft system that is used to place a structure into the world.</li>
<li><strong>Processors</strong>: The technical vanilla minecraft system that allows a Structure Piece in a JigSaw to be modified and drastically change its looks.</li>
<li><strong>Structure Piece</strong>: A single piece of a JigSaw structure, in our case, one room.</li>
<li><strong>Gridsize (lenght)</strong>: The lenght of a single dimension of the smallest possible room. All other size rooms are multiplications of this (1x, 2x or 3x). The grid value we are working with is: 15.</li>
<li><strong>roomsize</strong>: The size of the rooms, often noted as XxYxZ, and mostly multiples of the gridsize is used, ie: 3x3x3. Note that the Y value denotes height.</li>
<li><strong>Standard room</strong>: Rooms made out of processor blocks, that after being processed, makes the rooms the game is played in. Standard come in varying room sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Processor blocks</strong>:	A few groups of blocks that the processor replaces with themed blocks. Those blocks are used in standard rooms, to be themed with a processor every time they are generated in game.</li>
<li><strong>Theme</strong>: A set of blocks linked to each used processor block, all with a weight (probability). The processor uses this to determine which block needs to be used to replace every processor block in the standard room.</li>
<li><strong>Point of Interest (PoI)</strong>:	A small structure that is generated inside the room, containing mob spawners and loot. They can be either: standing isolated on ground, partly inside the wall, in a corner, or hanging from the ceiling. All can have varying sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Doorway</strong>: A 3x5 hole in the wall, through which a player gets in or out of a room. They are on set locations, often (but not exlusively) 1 on each vertical face, so 4 per room. Rooms are generated from doorway to doorway, with a ring in between.</li>
<li><strong>Ring</strong>: A 3x5x1 ring of blocks, between 2 doorways. They are used to connect rooms, and to generate the next room.</li>
<li><strong>Stable room</strong>: A strictly 3x3x3 room, with a door in the middle of each verical face. All 4 doors are easely reachable from one another, without having to dig or travel large parts of the room. Stable rooms are the first rooms in the rift, and they are straightforward and coherent.</li>
<li><strong>Unstable room</strong>: A 3xYx3 room, with doors in the center only. The doors are not necessarily easily reachable, and a player might require to first travel to a corner, before having access to the door. Mostly used as a room between Stable and Chaos.</li>
<li><strong>Chaos room</strong>: All other rooms that are not Stable or Unstable. Doors are on set places, but not all door are open, and not every face has exactly 1 door. Those rooms are confusing and complex, and are placed on the outside of the rift.</li>

<p><em>Design note</em>: Something like this would require an adequate replacement for improving gear. The current Gear Sockets and runegem <em>PoC</em>, applicable to vanilla items too, covers such a need. Other directions with modifiers would require to keep this poll result into account.</p>
<h3 id="yes-but-only-remove-for-wotrift-items-1"><a class="header" href="#yes-but-only-remove-for-wotrift-items-1">Yes, but only remove for WotRift items</a></h3>
<p>The enchanting table will not work for items from the WotRift mod. Vanilla items and items from other mods will still be enchantable, but their enchants will be disabled in the rifts.</p>
<p><em>Technical note</em>: Disabling enchants in the rift is a very complex endeavor and will require a lot of work. This option thus is considered the worst possible option by the dev team.</p>
<h3 id="no-enchanting-should-stay-but-disabled-in-rifts"><a class="header" href="#no-enchanting-should-stay-but-disabled-in-rifts">No, Enchanting should stay, but disabled in rifts</a></h3>
<p>Enchanting will remain in the mod. Items can still be enchanted as normal. But most or all of the enchants will be disabled in rifts to prevent balancing issues.</p>
<p><em>Technical note</em>: See previous point.</p>
<h3 id="no-enchanting-should-stay-and-be-usable-in-rifts"><a class="header" href="#no-enchanting-should-stay-and-be-usable-in-rifts">No, Enchanting should stay and be usable in rifts</a></h3>
<p>Enchanting will remain in the mod. Items can still be enchanted as normal. Rifts will be balanced around this, this will make the modifier system less useful and less impactful, especially when overpowered modded enchants are added. Consideration need to be made to make enchanting the main modifier system.</p>

<h1 id="notes"><a class="header" href="#notes">Notes</a></h1>
<p>Date: February 22 2025 Time: 8PM UTC</p>
<h2 id="-summary-and-decisions-"><a class="header" href="#-summary-and-decisions-">== Summary and decisions ==</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A LOT of movements towards MVP in Rune Anvil/Socket, Rift Generation, Modifier System, Inventory Snapshots, Accessibility Configs, Builder Glasses, Rift Entry Portal, 3Dd Rift Mapper, First Chest Variant, Dev Tools.</li>
<li>Devs please delete branches that have been merged in.</li>
<li>Rift mapper is running and will be 3d because rift will have height as well.</li>
<li>Durability is removed from everything because durability is lame.</li>
<li>Accessibility setting added for different things that can be adjusted.</li>
<li>Rift entrance visual has been created.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-game-design-"><a class="header" href="#-game-design-">== Game Design ==</a></h2>
<p>Rifts:
Rift key - determining what this is/ how the player will create is really important for making progress in MVP
Rift entrance, themes, tiered rift levels, spawners, RiftMapper are also things to discuss.</p>
<p>Progression:
Skill trees - do we want or no? How do we wanna do them? What is a skill tree?
Gear Progression - How do we progress gear? Just modifiers or add more?
Gear base - how to make weapon/armor more unique?
Skill Mechanic - What type of skills will we have
Build-A-Spell - How do we want to do spells and have them easily expandable.
Abilities -
Endgame - what do we want to do for endgame? What should the player be working for? Please go discuss.</p>
<p>Other:
Durability - Gone
Unique Biomes - should this be in Overworld? What rift related things do we want to have in overworld?
Damage Types - how would we want to implement this? What type of damage types would we want?
Eras of Progression - Barry Summary: 5 eras, Era of Exploration keeps it pretty basic and goal is to introduce the player to the core mechanics of the modpack that are different from vanilla minecraft, Era of Expansion we start to add onto the core concepts bringing in some of the more complex aspects such as potentially modifying rifts/gear, skills open up alot more etc., Era of Stabilization/Experimentation Player has a decent grasp on what the pack adds and maybe has a build/playstyle they are actively working towards, or are experimenting with alot of playstyles and builds, Era of Perfection all tools are available to the player, probably the most grindy era focus is on perfecting the build and entering endgame content, Era of Conclusion the player is fully into the endgame and maybe big final boss fight, not all players necessarily make it here and thats ok. For more info see link in links section.</p>

<p>Key forge demo - rift key forge shown with different materials and different rift tiers being able to be created from more “expensive” materials. Materials used determine the theme of the rift. New portal texture and it is very cool.</p>
<p>Rift update - Portal room has 4 entrances/exits, performance side needs some work, rift level determines rift size, level 20 rift is bigger than the biggest vaults in VH, hallways are being removed.</p>
<p>Ditto Blocks - Added blocks that can copy the texture of other blocks, which allows us to give blocks different properties. One that was showcased was “Spring Blocks” which would have a trampoline like effect for the player. There is slight differentiation so you can tell the difference, they can be traps or be mined and used as a tool. “Trap Blocks” were also shown which disappear after a short time to drop the player below. There are also variations specifically to trigger on mob vs player.</p>
<p>Build server - needs more rooms and more POI’s please fill out form in build section for room ideas, feedback on rooms, take note of the structures and the processor blocks that have code currently, if you need a special one make note of it and preferably also code it. There is a room section and a POI section, we need more thoughts/examples for both.</p>

<p>Tiebreaker poll for name - Wanderers of the Rift won! We will start using the new name.</p>
<p>New channel called community polls - used for polls to community, 1st poll is durability poll to decide if we are keeping durability.</p>
<p>Enchanting - do we want Vanilla like enchanting in the game and to what extent. Check out discussion in the forums. Probably going to have poll on enchanting poll next week.</p>
<h2 id="-mvp-updates--2"><a class="header" href="#-mvp-updates--2">== MVP Updates ==</a></h2>
<p>We really need rooms! We only have two rooms and one POI.</p>
<p>Builds are really important so we can have interesting rifts. We are wanting to aim for even more than VH.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to throw something down even if you don't consider yourself good at building.</p>
<p>Decision Process - Discussion in voice or chat -&gt; Idea polishing in Forums -&gt; Polling for options (more than 2) -&gt; Guidelines / Results published on mdBook once decision is taken -&gt; Changes/Actions timelines depending on decisions.</p>
<p>Also reference guide in mdBook:  https://dimension-delvers.github.io/dimension-delvers-docs/polls/polls.html</p>
<p>We wont have a playtesting team, everyone is the playtesting team</p>
<h2 id="-deemos-"><a class="header" href="#-deemos-">== Deemos ==</a></h2>
<p>Skill gem demo from Divides By Zero - Different gems would be upgradable with different number/tier of options. Skill trees are randomly generated per gem, so two base gems are not necessarily going to end up being the same.</p>
<p>Ability demo from Patrigan created by RobotMonkey - ability that summons skeletons and then they explode and die when they hit the ground. Cooldown indicator top left. Summoning of skeletons is completely configured using datapacks. We have alot of flexibility and depth that can be done using the current system.  Ball Ball ability which has bouncy balls. Think of making abilities that work well together.</p>
