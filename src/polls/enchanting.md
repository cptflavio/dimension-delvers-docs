# Should we remove enchanting from the mod?
## Question
Should we remove enchanting from the mod? It is by itself already a heated topic. WotRift will introduce a new modifier system that will make enchanting fairly obsolete.

## Options
### Yes, remove Enchanting completely 
The enchanting table will no longer work and no enchantments can be applied to items. Will affect all vanilla and modded items.

Modded enchants in the pack that are necessary for mod features to work will be reworked into the modifier system.

*Design note*: Something like this would require an adequate replacement for improving gear. The current Gear Sockets and runegem *PoC*, applicable to vanilla items too, covers such a need. Other directions with modifiers would require to keep this poll result into account.
### Yes, but only remove for WotRift items
The enchanting table will not work for items from the WotRift mod. Vanilla items and items from other mods will still be enchantable, but their enchants will be disabled in the rifts.

*Technical note*: Disabling enchants in the rift is a very complex endeavor and will require a lot of work. This option thus is considered the worst possible option by the dev team.
### No, Enchanting should stay, but disabled in rifts
Enchanting will remain in the mod. Items can still be enchanted as normal. But most or all of the enchants will be disabled in rifts to prevent balancing issues.

*Technical note*: See previous point.
### No, Enchanting should stay and be usable in rifts
Enchanting will remain in the mod. Items can still be enchanted as normal. Rifts will be balanced around this, this will make the modifier system less useful and less impactful, especially when overpowered modded enchants are added. Consideration need to be made to make enchanting the main modifier system.
